      <p>
        To illustrate destructuring, we'll make a sandwich. Do you take
        everything out of the refrigerator to make your sandwich? No, you only
        take out the items you would like to use on your sandwich. Destructuring
        is exactly the same. We may have an array or object that we are working
        with, but we only need some of the items contained in these.
        Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is needed.

export default Destructuring;
